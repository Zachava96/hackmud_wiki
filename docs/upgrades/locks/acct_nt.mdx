The "acct_nt_min" stat controls the minimum number of transactions that the lock will pick for its range of transactions.

The lock spawns at rarities ((%1kiddie%)), ((%2h4x0r%)), and ((%3h4rdc0r3%)).

## Behavior

```
>>> user.loc {acct_nt:""}
Sigh. No. Your acct situation is not worth my time
```

Depending on the mode acct_nt is in, "large deposit", "net", "total earned/total spent (with/without memos)", a different approach may be required. A check of [[accts.transactions]] is needed to find the correct answer. Since acct_nt is only minute precise, it may be needed to add/subtract transaction amounts in order to get a correct solve.

### Mode: large deposit
